[{"id":1,"owner":1,"title":"Hello world","content":"A \"Hello, World!\" program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. \"Hello, World!\" is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it. \"Time to hello world\" (TTHW) is a metric for the time to author a \"Hello World\" program in a given programming language and run it. History: \"Hello, World!\" program by Brian Kernighan (1978) While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase \"Hello World!\" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book The C Programming Language [4] The example program in that book prints \"hello, world\", and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian Kernighan, Programming in C: A Tutorial:[5] - Wikipedia","created_at":1576506719083,"tags":["consult","it","hala"]},{"id":2,"owner":3,"title":"The building","content":"Building mr concerns servants in he outlived am breeding.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>\n<h2><u><strong>Where does it come from?</strong></u></h2>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>\n<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>","owner":4,"id":"bb31281c-1f4e-4272-890a-7e4350cacdf3","created_at":1577151417203},{"title":"Zigvy Technical Assignment Interview","tags":["zigvy","technical","interview"],"content":"<h2>Description</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>This is a <strong>Small Project Test</strong> for online interview at Zigvy Corp.
