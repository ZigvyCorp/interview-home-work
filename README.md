# My FrontEnd Homework

This project is my front-end homework. I've built it using a variety of modern web technologies to ensure a great user experience and efficient, maintainable code.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **Redux Saga**: A library that aims to make application side effects easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.
- **Redux Persist**: A library for saving and rehydrating a Redux store.
- **Ant Design (AntD)**: A design system with values of Nature and Determinacy for better user experience of enterprise applications.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

I hope you find this project interesting and informative.
