If you have any questions about the application, please contact thongtt0409@gmail.com

I will show you how to run this back-end app
First you run the command:
npm install
Then you create an environment variable file called .env
Copy the code from the .env.example file to the just created .env file
Then you save and run the : npm start command
Right now our server is running. I have prepared an api test file for you. Go to the src folder and then go to test.
Hope you enjoy this application.
Thank you for reading me,
Have a good day.
