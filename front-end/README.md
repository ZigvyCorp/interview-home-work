My name is Thong, i'm website developer, i have good skill in JavaScript, i try to learning and improving about new technology
If you have any questions about the application, please contact thongtt0409@gmail.com

According to your request, I used antd but I don't know much about it so I used material ui instead
I will show you how to run this front-end app
First you run the command:
npm install
Then you run
npm start
Wait for the application to open Log in to the 2 accounts that I have prepared for you to test in the back-end
and test the app's test sections
Hope you enjoy this application.
Thank you for reading me,
Have a good day.
