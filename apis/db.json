      "content": "A \"Hello, World!\" program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. \"Hello, World!\" is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it. \"Time to hello world\" (TTHW) is a metric for the time to author a \"Hello World\" program in a given programming language and run it. History: \"Hello, World!\" program by Brian Kernighan (1978) While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase \"Hello World!\" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book The C Programming Language [4] The example program in that book prints \"hello, world\", and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian Kernighan, Programming in C: A Tutorial:[5] - Wikipedia",

      "content": "I wonder if you are as confused about the design patterns as I was before. In my case, I developed my own personal projects before, with almost no thought of design. Therefore, there are many design defects and code implementation defects, which bring a lot of trouble for later maintenance and development iterations.\nBut to be a high-level developer, one of the basic requirements is to be proficient in design patterns. To this end, I read a lot of books and blogs about design patterns, but I only learned some theoretical knowledge at the beginning. I never put it into practice.\nIt was not until later that I began to study the source code of some well-known open-source projects and consulted many predecessors in real work that I gradually mastered the use of design patterns. Now I have summed up some of my experience and written this article, I hope it can help you.\nThis article discusses the use of the following design patterns:\nStrategy Pattern\nPublish–subscribe pattern\nDecorator Pattern\nChain of Responsibility Pattern",

      "content": "The number of words that one could learn is virtually endless. So, while I do know lots of words that aren’t super common, it’s nothing compared to what I don’t know. Recently, a friend remarked on the size of my vocabulary and asked how she might go about improving her own. This got me reflecting, and the reflecting led to me jotting some things down, and the jotting in turn gave way to an email, and the email led at last to the article now before you.\nBefore we dive into the four activities that made the most difference in helping me grow my vocabulary, let’s take a quick look at the different types of vocabulary.\nDifferent types of vocabulary\nTraditionally, two categories of vocabulary are distinguished: passive and active.\nPassive vocabulary includes all the words you might recognize when, say, reading or listening to someone speak, but not words that you could wield confidently on your own. Active vocabulary, on the other hand, includes all of the words you can comfortably use when speaking or writing. Typically, when people say they want to improve their vocabulary, what they really mean is that they want to improve their active vocabulary; they want to expand their store of usable words.\nFor the purpose of this particular article, I think it’s useful to add two additional vocabulary types into the mix: etymological and catachrestic.",

      "content": "We’ve all been somewhat scarred by language classes at school. Lessons felt boring and never seemed to be appropriate for our level nor feel exciting. The textbooks taught us pointless vocabulary. The exercises never felt new. The teacher didn’t know how to get pumped up.\nLanguage-learning shouldn’t be boring. It should be fun. We should feel a burst of dopamine when we’re about to start a study session. We should be looking forward to discovering more about the language.\nLuckily, we don’t have to rely on old learning strategies anymore. Textbooks are useful, but you don’t have to use them as you were told. You can even make your own.\nWhy and How To Create Your Own Language Textbook\nWhy you should make the best textbook you’ll ever own and ho\nmedium.com\nWe often overlook how much technology can help us. Sure, we’ll use it a bit, but there’s so much more potential out there. It’s time to unlock its power by mastering these 5 greatest technological opportunities. Be sure not to consider them as separate. Their strength appears by combining them.\n1. Radio & Videos\nLet’s start with the most obvious: Streaming services.\nWith Netflix, Amazon Prime and such, TV shows and movies are right at the tip of your finger. In an instant, you can watch something created in almost any language in the world, along with its subtitles. Don’t watch videos dubbed in English though, you’d be wasting a great opportunity to learn.\nYou can watch almost any movie in whatever language you want and choose the subtitles you need. If you’re starting, choose subtitles in your native language and get used to the flow of this new language. If you’re getting better, start considering changing the subtitles to fit the audio. Or even taking them off!\nThe Language Learning with Netflix extension for Chrome can add an extra layer of flexibility. Indeed, it allows you to have 2 languages set as subtitles and even to look up words on the side. If you’re curious about how to use it to its maximum potential, here’s an extensive guide on its possibilities.\n",
