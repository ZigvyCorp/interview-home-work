# Technical requirements met

- Infinite scrolling
- Use **redux** for state management (I used it for just 1 state because seems like we don't need redux for current requirements. I just used it for meeting the requirement)
- Use **redux-saga** to call API (the same with **redux**)
- Use **redux-persist**
- Routing
- Posts must be saved in local storage
- All APIs are RESTful
- Well design APIs

# Tech stacks

- Backend: **Nodejs** + **Express**
- Frontend: **React**
- Database: **MongoDB**
