## Hello, I am Nguyen Trong Quy - Frontend Developer:

- Thank you very much for taking the time to look at my test <3
- This project consists of two parts : Frontend and Backend
- I config BE run in port `localhost:3000` and FE run in port `localhost:3001`
- run the BE directory first then run the FE directory with the command `yarn dev`

## About FE:

- I use the main technologies react/typeScript,antd,styled-components,redux,redux-saga,react-infinite-scroll-component,redux-persist
- FE includes two routers: home-page and post-detail-page
- The Home page is scroll infinite
- Content summary - 100 first characters of the content
- Comments will be collapsed by default, display the count of the comments for each post
- Click on comment, the comments section will be expanded and render all post's comments
- User can search for a post with a given keywords (title)
- Use redux-persist to persist data
- All posts must be saved in local storage or persisted within redux

## About BE

-The main technologies I use are ExpressJs/TypeScript and MongoAtlas
-Server Structure is MCV
-The project includes routers : `users`, `posts`,`comments`
-I'm not really good at BE but i can improve it

## Thank you again, hope you have a good day ! Happy coding !
